How to Run the Multi-Language Project
====================================

1. Prerequisites
----------------
- Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- (Optional) Python 3, if you want to use the simple web server for the frontend.
- Start Docker Desktop

2. Build and Start All Language Services
----------------------------------------
From the project root directory, run:

    docker-compose up --build

This command will build and start all language service containers. Each service will be available on its own port (9001-9015).

3. Serve the Frontend
---------------------
In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory:

    cd frontend

Start a simple web server (using Python 3):

    python3 -m http.server 8080

This will serve the frontend at http://localhost:8080

4. View the Output
------------------
Open your web browser and go to:

    http://localhost:8080

You will see messages from every programming language service, each with a button to show the code snippet.

5. Stopping the Services
------------------------
To stop all running containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal running docker-compose, or run:

    docker-compose down
